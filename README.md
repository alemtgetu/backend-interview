## KUNGFUAI Forked

Using the NodeJS application framework NestJS, create a TODO list application that persists the TODOs to a database.

Features:

- Create a TODO
- Edit an existing TODO
- Delete an existing TODO
- See all of the todos

### Server Address

- http://100.25.157.4:3000

### Endpoints

- /tasks, Get -- list all tasks
- /tasks/:id, Get -- get on task
- /tasks, Post -- create/add a task
- /tasks/:id, Patch -- update/edit a task
- /tasks/:id, Delete -- delete/remove a task

Use any of the Cloud Providers listed below to deploy your solution

- AWS
- GCP
- Azure

### Deployed On AWS EC2

- API and dockerized Posgres DB are hosted on same EC2
- SG for the EC2 instance Inbound Rules looks as follows
  - Port 5432 open for only the instance's SG
  - Port 22 to allow connection coming only from my home IP
  - Port 3000 open to world (It's not good idea to open your applications port to world, reverse proxy will be much secure)
  - Port 80 open to the world (was planning to implement NestJs to listen on port 80 instead of 3000)
